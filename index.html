		<h3>Backstory</h3>
		<p>Naruto Uzumaki is a shinobi of the Hidden Leaf village. He lived throughout the village by himself, due to his parents dying in an effort to save their son at birth. Their death was caused by a man who wore a mask and named Tobi.Tobi infiltrated the hideout where Naruto's mom, Kushina, had given birth to Naruto. Tobi sought out kushina to release the nine tails that was sealed inside of her to devastate the Hidden Leaf village. Minato, Naruto's father, had tried to fight off the nine tails, but he had no choice but to seal the nine tails within his son. Being that Naruto was an infant the nine tails' chakra was too immense to seal within him. So Minato sacrified his soul to split the fox's chakra in half within Naruto. </p>
