                    <p>Naruto has learned how to counter genjutsu from Jiraiya, but has limited skill in using it. As an Uzumaki and a reincarnation of Asura Otsutsuki, Naruto has massive reserves of strong chakra, estimated as at least four times greater than Kakashi's and described by Karin as "bright and warm." Naruto's control improved greatly over time, becoming able to transfer his chakra to others. He later receives chakra from the other tailed beasts and Hagoromo Otsutsuki, increasing his reserves further. Naruto's powerful life force grants him an extreme longevity, healing power, stamina, and vitality. In Part I, He often utilised shadow clones or Kurama's chakra to engage or overwhelm his enemies in combat; with the former, he has created techniques such as the Naruto Uzumaki Combo.</p>
                    <p> Naruto becomes more capable in taijutsu due to Jiraiya's training, being able to contend with other skilled users, including a pair of skilled kenjustu users single-handed. By adulthood, Naruto's improved taijutsu allows him to defeat dozens of opponents without using shadow clones or enhancements.</p>

                    <p>Due to his Uzumaki lineage and being Kurama's jinchuriki his entire life, Naruto's chakra has more effectively mixed with the fox's, allowing him to perform several chakra-taxing techniques without feeling fatigued. Realising he could not avoid using Kurama's power, Naruto sought to learn how to control it with help from Killer B, the jinchuriki of Gyuki, and unexpectedly, his own mother, Kushina. Naruto attains Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, which greatly increases his speed, strength, and defences. Eventually, when Kurama acknowledges Naruto's life-long strength of character and Naruto learns the fox's true name, their new-found friendship grants Naruto access to Kurama Mode, another increase in physical abilities. Naruto has also received chakra from the other tailed beasts during the Fourth Shinobi World War, making him a human pillar for the power of Ten Tails. This allows him to access their unique abilities himself or infuse them into his Rasengan and its variants. </p>

                    <p>During his shinobi career, he learns several ninjutsu styles from Jiraiya, such as how to summon toads of Mount Myoboku.. He becomes skilled in shurikenjutsu, barrage an enemy using shadow clones. Naruto's ability to sense chakra is shown only through his modes. He can identify chakra signatures from vast distances in Sage Mode, detect negative emotions in Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, and empower his sensory abilities to the highest possible level in Six Paths Sage Mode. Naruto's second trademark technique is the Rasengan, a one-handed technique created by his father. Over time, Naruto's improved skill allows him to produce larger versions of the Rasengan, perform it faster, and even have his shadow clones make their own Rasengan.  Naruto can utilise all five nature transformations, as well as Yinâ€“Yang Release. After Jiraiya's death, Naruto was trained in senjutsu at Mount Myoboku, requiring his high chakra reserves. Naruto can combine also Sage Mode with Kurama's chakra to further enhance his abilities, such that he can resist Nagato's control, shatter Truth-Seeking Balls and, two years later, fly without the use of Six Paths Senjutsu. In Six Paths Sage Mode,  his eyes become yellow and his pupils take on a cross-like shape without manifesting the orange pigmentation around his eyes present in Sage Mode. Naruto can also don a new chakra cloak similar to Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, which he can access instantly and maintain much longer than Sage Mode.</p>

                    <p>While often acting without thinking, Naruto's years as a prankster has given him a cunning imagination that is useful in battle. Naruto's most famous skill lies in his ability to deceive his opponents, making effective uses of even the most simple techniques to trick the deadliest of opponents.  He can formulate multi-step plans or backup plans in the thick of battle, and act quickly even when given new information.  His strategies typically involve shadow clones: he may direct his opponent's attentions towards one of his clones to disguise his own movements; he may transform them into objects or other individuals for surprise attacks; he may make himself seem predictable by creating a pattern, just to throw them off by breaking it. Naruto is rather observant, able to notice details others may overlook and subsequently take advantage of them to overcome his opponents.</p>
